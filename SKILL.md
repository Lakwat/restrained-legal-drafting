# Restrained Legal Drafting

Apply this skill when drafting, revising, or rendering a formal legal document that should look conventional, serious, and deliberately plain.

## Scope

This skill controls writing style, document architecture, and visual presentation. It does not prescribe the mandatory procedural structure of a claim, complaint, appeal, submission, motion, or other jurisdiction-specific instrument. Follow any binding court, authority, institutional, or user-supplied rules first. Do not invent filing requirements.

## Default working method

1. Identify the document's purpose, audience, jurisdiction, relevant facts, legal basis, requested outcome, and evidentiary sources from the user's materials.
2. Do not ask again for information already supplied. Ask only for missing facts that materially affect accuracy or the requested outcome. When a minor fact is unavailable, use a clear placeholder outside the final document or state the assumption separately.
3. Verify current law and procedural claims from authoritative sources when research is required. Never fabricate quotations, authorities, dates, paragraph references, exhibits, or factual allegations.
4. Draft the substance in continuous prose with a limited number of broad, numbered sections. Use numbered paragraphs when granular referencing is useful. Prefer paragraphs over tables, bullet lists, cards, matrices, or summary boxes.
5. Remove repetition, generic filler, rhetorical inflation, and unnecessary restatements of the issue. Each paragraph should advance a fact, legal proposition, application, or requested conclusion.
6. Render the final document according to the presentation rules below. Keep drafting notes, caveats, and explanations outside the document.

## Presentation rules

Use black text on a white background. Use no colour, icons, logos, page borders, shaded boxes, callouts, decorative rules, sidebars, banners, or consultancy-style design.

Use Times New Roman unless the user or a binding format rule requires another typeface. As a neutral default, use 11-point body text, 9-point footnotes, justified alignment, restrained spacing, and conventional A4 margins. Keep emphasis sparse. Use bold primarily for the title and numbered section headings; avoid decorative italics and excessive underlining.

Do not create a cover page, contents page, executive summary, abstract, keywords section, document-control table, revision history, or annex list unless the user or an applicable rule specifically requires it.

Place the document title once near the beginning. Do not repeat the title, case name, document type, party names, or section name as a running header on later pages. Use no running header by default.

The footer must contain the centred page number only. Use a plain Arabic numeral such as `1`. Do not write `Page 1`, `1 of 7`, a filename, a date, a confidentiality notice, or any other footer text unless a binding rule overrides this instruction.

Treat the document as a formal attachment or standalone legal instrument, not as a letter. Do not add sender and recipient address blocks, salutations, email-style subject lines, courtesy closings, or contact panels unless the requested document is actually a letter. Do not add a signature block unless requested or required.

Use tables only when the user expressly asks for one or when a binding form makes one unavoidable. Otherwise convert structured material into concise numbered paragraphs.

## Drafting style

Write in formal, precise, natural legal prose. Prefer concrete statements to abstract summaries. Avoid headings every few paragraphs; combine related material into broader sections. Avoid mini-headings disguised as italic opening sentences.

Maintain a clear progression: relevant facts, applicable law, application, and requested outcome, adapted to the document's actual purpose. This is an editorial sequence, not a mandatory procedural template.

Use complete first citations and precise pinpoints when sources are available. Keep citation style consistent. Footnotes should support specific propositions rather than collect broad, undifferentiated references. Do not duplicate the same sources in both footnotes and an annex merely to make the document appear more substantial.

Do not include statements such as “AI-generated,” “draft for review,” “legal advice disclaimer,” “here is your document,” or explanations of the formatting choices inside the document unless the user expressly requests them.

DO NOT CALL A CLAIM, CUSTOMER SUPORT CLAIM, OR SIMILAR A "FORMAL CLAIM" ON THE TITLE. THE WORD "FORMAL" HERE IS CRINGEY AF BRO

## Final quality check

Before delivery, confirm that:

- the document contains no unsupported factual or legal assertion;
- the requested outcome is stated clearly;
- sectioning is limited and useful;
- prose is predominantly paragraph-based;
- there are no unnecessary tables, bullets, boxes, decorative elements, or repeated running headings;
- the title appears once;
- the footer contains only a centred numeral;
- there is no cover page or contents page unless required;
- citations are consistent and pinpointed where possible;
- drafting notes and explanations are outside the document; and
- the final PDF or DOCX has no overflow, clipped text, blank trailing page, broken footnotes, or inconsistent pagination.

## User overrides

A specific instruction from the user or a binding filing rule overrides the defaults in this skill. Apply the narrowest necessary deviation and preserve the restrained style everywhere else.
